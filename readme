9 dimensions of freedom IMU

This project connects to 9DOF module from www.geeetech.com (also known as Razor 
9DOF), this module can be flashed with Arduino tool, because it has also 
some atmel microcontroller incorporated. For visualization of informations from
3 axis accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer, I decided to use html+javascript.
This time I wanted nice graphical representation of device position/alignment,
so I used the WebGL technology for the first time.

For interfacing serial device to web browser, a proxy utility is necessary,
proxy.cpp can be compiled in visual studio as terminal application.

Unfortunatelly my 9DOF module is broken and the ADXL345 accelerometer always
returns value 511 for Z-axis, I tried to fix it by calculating this accelration
with Pytaghoras equation, but this workaround is far from perfect.
